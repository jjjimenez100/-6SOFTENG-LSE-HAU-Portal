                    <h4>"The birth of our organization was unexpected. As the founder of this organization, I will confess to you that I am also one of those
                        people who were surprised of our existence. It all started when I received a letter from CEFA.VNIVERSITAS.HAU last October 2015 inviting me to be
                        part of the Ab Initio VI Scholarship. After series of talks about "Leading Leaders: Youth in Nation Building" and "Good Governance", Ab initio scholars
                        are mandated to create a VOICES Analysis, where our group, after series of meetings, planned to focus on two fields: Culture and Heritage and, Education.</h4>
                        <h4>One of the significant events that also contributed to the birth of this organization is the USC and CSC Elections 2016. I ran for
                            the position USC CEA Senator under Kayabe together with Justin Andrew Guzman and Hannah Mae Santos. The three of us agreed to focus on the campaign
                            "We Listen to your Voice, 'Cause Your Choice Matters. Shout it Out Angelites!" and under this campaign are platforms creating an open student council
                            for everyone. During the campaign period, after launching this and leaving a promise that we'll listen to all of their concerns, one of the concerns
                            the students raised to us that caught my attention is the number of failing students in our college and the low passing rate in board exams. In my
                            personal belief, I believe that the only way to resolve this issue is to promote academic awareness by empowering students in the field of academics.
                            This gave birth to the "The A Teams/Acad Circle Project." That was counted as one of the project of "KayaBAES: Bilis Aksyon sa Estudyante'y Solusyon",
                            the Kayabe's USC Line-up for the USC Elections 2016.
                        </h4><h4>During the USC Meeting de Avance last Feb. 29, 2016, the USC CEA Senatorial candidates were asked about the issue of the number of
                            failing students and low passing rates in the board exams of our college. Representing the Kayabe USC CEA Senatoriables, I answered it by
                            saying: </h4>
                        <blockquote style="border-color: #909090;"><p>"Naniniwala po ang Kayabe na kapag nakapag-exam na ang isang estudyante, o nakapagtake na siya
                                ng board exam, hindi na natin mababago kung ano ang magiging resulta noon. Kung hindi siya handa, wala na tayong magagawa. Ngunit hindi nun ibig
                                sabihin na wala na tayong magagawa. Ang solusyon sa problemang ito ay ang paghanda sa bawat estudyante bago ang exams o ng board sa pamamamagitan
                                ng maaaring direktang pagreview o pagmotivate sa kanila habang naghahanda pa lamang ito para sa hamon ng board exams. Tulad nga ng nabanggit kanina ng
                                aming Presidentiable, and Incumbent VP-Internal ng USC ngayon na si G. Dominic de Leon, isa po sa proyekto namin ay ang "The A Team" na tungkol sa pagbuo
                                ng isang organisasyon ng mga volunteer student teachers na handang tumulong para sa ikauunlad ng hindi lamang ng CEA kundi ng buong HAU na magsisimula
                                ng pagbabago sa pamamagitan ng pag-buo ng mga "Acad Circles" na isang formalized study group at pag-impluwensya sa kapwa nitong estudyante para maging
                                handa sa mas malaking pangarap na sumabay hindi lamang sa mga akademikong institusyon sa Pilipinas kundi sa iba't iba pang institusyon sa buong mundo.
                                Yan po ang plano namin ng Kayabe para sa inyo."</blockquote>

                        <h4>This is the first time that a solution was raised publicly in the university and we were happy after receiving 8 out of 9 thumbs up
                            from the panel after answering the question. Unfortunately, I lost the USC Elections, but that never stopped us.</h4>
                        <h4>In our CEFA.VHAU Ab Initio Graduation last March 22-23, 2016, I, representing our group (Me, Patrick Martinez and Rodmar Salarda),
                            presented two VOICES Analysis entitled "HAU Misasanmetung" and "HAU Keen and Savvy". HAU Misasanmetung is about creating an organization
                            for Kapampangan Enthusiasts in Holy Angel University that will call for unity between all Kapampangan Youth Enthusiasts Orgs in Central
                            Luzon. HAU Keen and Savvy is about creating an organization for academic awareness where acad circles will be formed. HAU K and S is a
                            better version of the platform I raised in the USC Elections 2016 (The A Team Platform). HAU Misasanmetung was noted by the outgoing
                            officers to be under consideration to be part of the future projects of CEFA.VHAU, while HAU Keen and Savvy was rejected, but not because
                            they don't want the project. CEFA.VHAU '15-'16 CEO John Darwin Timoteo said:</h4>
                        <blockquote style="border-color: #909090;"><p>"The project is actually nice. It's beneficial to the students
                                especially with the idea of the 'Acad Circles' your group wants. We'll choose HAU Misasanmetung because it's more fitted in the CEFA.VHAU
                                Mission and Vision, but I suggest that the HAU Keen and Savvy should be presented in the University Student Councils or in the CASED
                                (Now SAS and SEd) College Student Council. It's a good project to be implemented in the university."</blockquote>

                        <h4>With this, the next day, I sent the copy of the VOICES analysis to USC President Darhen Pascua who endorsed us to the Office of the
                            Student Services and Affairs for accreditation. With Joseph Marion Lozano, Jake Caligagan, Chantelle Ariola, Chandley Miranda,
                            Theresa Jane Miranda, and Reinher Miranda, we successfully established the first organization in Holy Angel University with the
                            concern about Academic Development in the University.
